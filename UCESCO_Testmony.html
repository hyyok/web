    <p>Education is light and one of the keys to escape a lifetime cycle of poverty in our communities.<br />
        We believe that under no circumstances should any child, the future generation, be subjected to an undesirable
        school environment. In the communities we are serving, it is heartbreaking that children have had to struggle
        choosing between getting their right to education and maintaining safety. Without proper classrooms, they are
        forced to study in unstable, unstructured classrooms which are unable to sustain rainy season, while sharing the
        few available resources with many other classmates. </p>
    <div><span><img src="./img/silver.png" alt="silver"></span><span><img src="./img/gem.png" alt="gem"></span></div>
    <p>Silver Spring Secondary school currently has 16 volunteers working with the school who are sustained through an
        appreciative allowance. About 3400 students so far are alumnus of Silver Springs School since it was started and
        3000 have graduated from various universities and colleges, Joined Military and some currently are playing for
        Kenya National Sport. </p>
    <p>When GEM Wellington School family from United Arab Emirate (UAE) visited us under the leadership of our brother
        and friend- Jonathan Lucus, it was unfortunate that they witnessed the bad state our school was in, despite our
        tireless efforts to make it as presentable as possible with the available resources and options at hand. The
        burden was heavy and having to balance between improving the structures of the school against providing quality
        education for our children was devastating. The school was at the verge of closure which indeed would affect
        majority of our children who solely depend on our free education and meals.</p>
    <p>John’s team was able to construct two(2) classrooms. The children could not be more grateful, depicting joy
        through tears and huge smiles. The 2 classrooms are almost complete, with only the floor, Corridor, Paintwork
        and Furnishing with desks remaining. This gives our unprivileged children Hope. Hope makes it possible. And Hope
        keeps them moving.<br />The effects of the Corona virus have not left us behind as well. With the government
        implementing various directives to curb the fast spreading virus, it has, through ministry of health and
        education demanded the following;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Washing points where student has to wash hands.(we are in need of minimum of 15 water containers)</li>
        <li>Extra class rooms for social distance.</li>
        <li>Soap or sanitizers enough for the students.</li>
        <li>Masks of over 2000 in number.</li>
        <li>Enough toilets for the students.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our 5-year vision plan includes training the students in Marginalized rural areas and urban slums, especially
        girls, to be self-reliant on the CBC. We expect to make our school acquire an international status, whereby our
        students will be able to travel all over the world either in academia or in the sports arena. We also expect to
        enroll over 5000 students from the community with an intentional goal to reduce the rate of illiteracy amongst
        the less privileged. This is the change we want to impact on our children and strive to model them to becoming
        the role models their communities need.</p>
    <h4>KYLE’S STORY </h4>
    <div><span><img src="./img/keyla.png" alt="keyla"></span><span><img src="./img/scoreboard.png"
                alt="scoreboard"></span></div>
    <p>Kyle is from Kenya, one of the beneficiaries of the School, active member and club leader of UCESCO Pathers Rugby
        Club. Cathy Keyla is 17 years old and is in grade ten. She is the first born in a family of three headed, she is
        an Orphan and resides in Children home. </p>
    <p><i>“Now I am happy I will continue to pursue my dream. This is the only school that gives me hope and makes me
            feel I have a family. Many thanks to Jonathan with all GEM Wellington family UAE for yours continues support
            to our School from clothes, food and now to constructing two beautiful classes for us. May our might God
            bless you So much John, Furrah, Laura and Meera. There was too much dodging for lessons because of the state
            of the School which looked poor but now our School looks beautiful”.</i></p>
    <p><i>“Now, the School has 3 new classes almost complete, I also hope that the Kitchen, latrines and library will be
            improved with more comfortable and desks and studying areas, playground and more books for revision . I am
            also praying one day, our School can have a school Bus, especially for UCESCO Panthers Rugby Club for
            competition. I always feel sad when I see only us walk by foot to compete with other Schools, the only day
            we are lucky is when we use public transport. I sometimes ask God “Why us?”. When I grow up I want to help
            many girls like me who have lost hope to have hope and to acquire Education. Education is the only best gift
            you can give us to help us from exploitation and abuse, physical and psychological health risk, unwanted
            pregnancies and early marriages. Thank you UCESCO management, our School teachers, Directors who goes extra
            mile to deep into his pocket to support me when I am in need of something urgently especially as a girl. God
            bless you all”</i></p>
    <p>This is how the School looked when John and his team visited us</p>
