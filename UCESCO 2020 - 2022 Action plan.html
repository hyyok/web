    <p>United Cultural Empowerment & Social Community Organization (UCESCO) is a charity organization, committed to
        increasingly and sustainably address poverty amongst vulnerable households located in informal settlements and
        rural villages. We empower local Women to serve the poor and vulnerable, creating sustainable transformation in
        their communities. Currently, we are serving 18 marginalized communities in Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.</p>
    <p>UCESCO believes that when women have control over their assets and income, they reinvest in their families and
        communities. They are therefore able to provide basic necessities like more nutritious food, education for their
        children, and access to better health care. That’s why we invest in women and female business owners, equipping
        them with the tools and expertise they need to make their talents/Skills/businesses thrive and grow. </p>

    <p>Actively and sustainably develop vulnerable women and children through education and by diversifying their income
        streams, to increase their economic viability; through the creation of an environment that promotes social
        change in enhancing their livelihoods</p>
    <h4 id="Introduction4" style="color:  rgb(11, 157, 241)"><i>UCESCO’s Vision</i></h4>
    <p>To see a world where disadvantaged women living in informal settlements and marginalized areas in Africa are
        valued in society and empowered to create sustainable and impactful change</p>
    <h4 id="Context">Context</h4>
    <p>We are in a season where an unforeseen virus (Covid-19) is directly or indirectly affecting the entire human race
        regardless of age, geographical location, economic and health status. As we are all aware, the Coronavirus
        Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that recently emerged in Wuhan, China and has rapidly spread
        globally due to its highly contagious nature.</p>
    <p>Since the first cases were cited in Wuhan sometime in December 2019, the number of people infected has been
        increasing at an alarming rate. As of the time of writing, the numbers were approaching 16,659,409 infections
        globally with 656,853 fatalities in 190 countries. </p>
    <p>As this pandemic continues to rise, it is likely to affect the following in the communities we are serving;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Large numbers of children are likely to be orphaned and become vulnerable to exploitation and abuse,
            physical and psychological health risk. At the same time, children, especially those from vulnerable
            women-led households in urban slums (informal settlement) are likely to experience exacerbated rates of
            child labor, sexual exploitation, unwanted pregnancies, early marriages and incidences of violence. </li>
        <li>Low income families have and continue to lose livelihood’s as a result of job cuts, business closures and
            unavailability of casual jobs.</li>
        <li>Disruptions in domestic food supply chains, other shocks affecting food production and loss of incomes
            and remittances are creating strong tensions and food security risks in these communities. The United
            Nations World Food programme has warned that an estimated 265 million people could face acute food
            insecurity by the end of 2020. Up from 135 million people before the crisis, because of income and
            remittance losses. If farmers are experiencing acute hunger, they may also prioritize buying food today over
            planting seeds for tomorrow, raising the threat of food shortage in coming years. Some of the communities we
            are serving are “hotspots” because of multiple crisis resulting from locusts’ plague infestation, Covid-19
            crisis and poverty.</li>
        <li>WHO continues to warn that “Africa should prepare for the worst”! Unfortunately, what may be even more
            devastating than the disease itself is the socio-economic impact on many of the poor vulnerable communities
            we serve. With most countries closing business, halting projects, and initiating lockdowns, the people most
            affected by this will be low wage earners working in the informal economy, living on daily income that will
            now be unstable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Authorities have established that without stringent intervention, the imminent impact would be much worse and
        completely overwhelming, especially in countries and communities with fragile healthcare systems, low healthcare
        infrastructure, scarcity of protective supplies, very few or no isolation facilities, and a low level of
        community awareness.</p>
    <p>With this reality, the Covid- 19 situation has become our primary concern and focus. UCESCO staff and volunteers,
        as well as all community leaders, have been informed and are coming together as one to respond to this disaster.
        Mitigation and reconstruction once the pandemic is over, are therefore paramount. We also encourage
        organizations with similar mindset to act now to stop this health crisis from transforming into a food crisis.
        The fallout from Covid-19 may push rural families in the 18 disadvantaged communities we are currently serving
        even deeper into poverty, hunger and desperation, which is a real threat to global prosperity and stability.
        With immediate action, we can provide rural people with tools to adapt and ensure a quicker recovery; averting
        an even bigger humanitarian crisis.</p>
    <p>UCESCO serves among the urban and rural poor. The urban poor live mostly in slums, which are crowded and
        compromise preventive measures. On health and containment of the disease; health facilities in these communities
        are inadequate, there are no isolation facilities, intensive care units, or access to respiratory equipment. To
        complicate the situation further, social distancing of identified cases in these areas is impossible as people
        live in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions and many (especially in the rural communities) are uninformed of
        the risks of contracting the virus. </p>
    <p>UCESCO has an opportunity to act now and of healing post the Covid -19 Crisis; empowering the communities for
        this and walking with them to mitigate and rebuild around this disaster. </p>
    <h4 id="ActionPlan">Proposed Action Plan 2020/2022 (During and Post Covid -19 Crisis)</h4>
    <p>Covid -19 has no vaccine or medical cure yet, and it is three times as infectious as the flu. Therefore, vigorous
        preventive measures are assumed to be the best option at this time. Based on the short window we have, as well
        as the nature of the disease and the potential of its quick spread, UCESCO has identified the following areas of
        action.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Immediate Action</li>
        <li>Post Covid-19 Action</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="ActionPlan1" style="color:  rgb(11, 157, 241)"><i>Immediate Action</i></h4>
    <p>UCESCO is quickly moving to set up a corona prevention and post Covid-19 Taskforce team in the 18 disadvantaged
        communities we are serving. The immediate proposed action through these taskforce teams primarily focuses on
        training, awareness creation, promotion of good personal hygiene practices and distribution of personal
        protective equipment (PPE) and hygiene materials. Since it is hard to predict for how long the virus will
        spread, the initial period of the “immediate action” is proposed to be for the first 4 months after the
        formation of the taskforce. </p>
    <p>UCESCO will be providing virtual training and hence will be sharing video links to enable our local partners
        respond to the pandemic. In areas where internet is unavailable, training for participants in small groups of
        less than 10 people with proper social distancing will be provided on site. </p>
    <p>The advantage we have is that our community organizing is already in place with trained trainers, economic
        working Women groups, community Vocational training centers, and established clusters and home-to-home visits.
        We will train our already organized local leaders who will then share effective messages to already identified
        groups and house to house awareness. By doing this, we can reduce/ avoid myths and distorted speculations that
        quickly spread and cause fear, panic and hopelessness. </p>
    <p>The training will mainly focus on the following key areas: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Covid-19 transmission, signs and symptoms, and contextualized prevention methods.</li>
        <li>Community mobilization and sensitization methods. </li>
        <li>Organizing and leading local responses to mitigate and reconstruct. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The participants and proposed numbers are stated below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>27 staff members that have been structured into task forces. </li>
        <li>360 volunteers (20 volunteers X 18 Communities). </li>
        <li>90 community leaders (5 leaders X 18 communities). </li>
    </ul>
    <h4><i>Awareness Creation</i></h4>
    <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the Covid-19 virus and how it
        spreads. UCESCO will be communicating basic simplified and culture-oriented messages to communities using
        various communication materials. Each community office will be able to translate messages into appropriate
        languages and give materials to project sites. </p>
    <p>The materials will primarily focus on basic information about the disease, transmission modes, major signs and
        symptoms to watch for preventive measures, and things to do when showing signs and symptoms. The following
        communication materials will be given to community sites. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>360 tri fold and standard posters (20 posters X 18 communities) posted in strategic places. </li>
        <li>3600 brochures (2,000 X 18 Communities) to be distributed during home visits.</li>
        <li>180 custom Vinyl banners (10 banners X 18 communities). </li>
        <li>360 T-shirts for task forces and house-to-house volunteers for identification and to spread key
            messages. </li>
        <li>Bulk SMS, Emails and WhatsApp as a mechanism for communication between our beneficiaries and UCESCO
            staff; as well as a platform for beneficiaries’ online feedback.</li>
        <li>Develop partnerships to train and equip communities we serve in informal settlements and rural areas
            with technology to deliver digital content and sell their products online. </li>
        <li>Provide alternative power sources such as solar where main grid power is not accessible. </li>
        <li>Conduct media awareness campaign for children of our beneficiaries, parents and school communities on
            health messages, safety, social risks and reduction measures. </li>
        <li>Empowering women by improving their knowledge of nutrition as well as promoting maternal nutrition and
            nutrition of adolescent girls’ dietary intake, and hygiene behaviors, to reduce under nutrition for entire
            generations. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4><i>Promotion of hand washing practices and Environment Hygiene</i></h4>
    <p>Proper handwashing is one of the very effective ways of halting the spread of the disease; and maybe the only
        hand cleaning method accessible to our communities. However, in most communities where we work, hand washing
        practices may be limited to once or twice per day, and often forgotten even at critical times. </p>
    <p>In order to promote this safe practice and sensitize the communities of its greater impact, UCESCO will be
        investing time and resources to create accessible hand washing public spots.</p>
    <h4><i>Distribution of personal protective Equipment (PPE) and hygiene materials</i></h4>
    <p>Second to hand washing, UCESCO will also provide PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), such as face masks, hand
        sanitizers and liquid soaps to minimize the spread. In identified locations, these will be distributed in
        packaged Kits. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>21,600 hand sanitizers – 300ml each (200 households x 18 communities) X 6 weeks. </li>
        <li>36,000 disposable face masks to be used by home visiting volunteers and also for the sick. </li>
        <li>43,200 bar soaps (200 households X 18 Communities) X 6 weeks X 2 Soaps</li>
        <li>Disinfect and fumigate schools around us to keep our beneficiaries’ children safe from Covid-19, within the
            communities we are serving. In rural and urban slums. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4><i>Short-term Financial Relief to affected families</i></h4>
    <p>Due to the high spreading potential of the disease, most household income of most for these vulnerable families
        is affected in communities where we serve; as they are dependent on their daily income. When companies are
        closed, or when their street-side business are no more, UCESCO will identify the most affected families through
        community volunteers and make temporary financial relief available. </p>
    <h4><i>Food Banks for most affected vulnerable women-led households</i></h4>
    <p>Since the disease will significantly have affected many families, either through loss of jobs or income, UCESCO
        will be partnering with our local women groups to provide weekly food rations for needy community Based Schools
        around us of about 3600 students from our beneficiaries. In some special cases for the homeless, UCESCO
        volunteers will cook and package meals. </p>
    <h4 id="ActionPlan2" style="color:  rgb(11, 157, 241)"><i>Post Covid-19 Crisis (Restorative Intervention) </i></h4>
    <p>UCESCO has Identified the following restorative actions and we believe these will be in place in the next two
        years. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>This is a critical time in which families and communities in general need encouragement and hope. UCESCO is
            well positioned to undertake this role. By doing scheduled home visits, the support team will be able to
            give counseling. The volunteers will use masks and social distancing for protection. They will also wear
            branded T-shirts for identification. </li>
        <li>Increase financial access for 9,000 families through partnerships with Micro-finance institutions in each of
            the UCESCO respective women groups in farming and Handcrafting. We have set up systems that can facilitate
            the support to trained beneficiaries. This service will be in high demand and we intend to begin the
            training sooner than later. </li>
        <li>Procure 2300-liter tanks or other alternative locally available materials with faucets for roof water
            harvesting/ Borehole to our surrounding 360 community-based schools, in the 18 communities we are serving in
            Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, where children of our beneficiaries are learning. These will help maintain hygiene
            standards including clean toilets, improve school gardens and the neighboring farming communities we are
            serving. </li>
        <li>Refurbish and expand classrooms of 180 schools within the communities we are serving, to create enough
            social distance for children in school. Most of the children studying in these schools come from households
            we are serving. We also plan to give scholarships to some vulnerable young girls in these communities</li>
        <li>Community-based school feeding programs to improve the health conditions of children of our beneficiaries in
            the 18 vulnerable communities we are serving, to prevent and treat common childhood malnutrition conditions
            and thus, increase participation in School. Proposed intervention: </li>
        <ol>
            <li>Sensitize School cooks on hygiene, sanitation and safe food preparation in these schools around us,
                where children of our beneficiaries are learning. </li>
            <li>Introducing fortified porridge according to increased needs due to Covid-19.</li>
            <li>Support child friendly environment, including access to water for drinking and washing and sanitation
                and hygiene facilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Conduct “Back to School” campaign for post Covid-19 recovering period within the 18 communities we are
            serving and support most vulnerable children of our beneficiaries who may have suffered due to Covid-19. We
            will also support most vulnerable girls within these communities with sanitary towels and other back to
            school kits. </li>
        <li>UCESCO will liaise with the department of social protection to provide additional assistance to our
            beneficiaries of cash transfer for orphans and most vulnerable children of our beneficiaries and mobilize
            community support for girls’ education including those who may have dropped out of school. </li>
        <li>UCESCO plans to set up 18 Greenhouses or other alternative locally farming methods in most affected
            communities we are serving (30ft x 72ft or 2160 square feet Movable High Tunnel). This will provide both
            immediate and long-term food relief, and recovery for these vulnerable communities to feed their children
            and those who rely on our school meals as their only source of nutrition, during these most challenging
            times we have collectively faced. Investing in nutrition through agriculture is not only socially
            responsible, it is sound development policy and good economics. Its impact is multi-generational, allowing
            children to reach their full physical and intellectual potential, so that they can grow into healthy adults
            and lift themselves out of poverty. The farms will produce: </li>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><i>VEGGIES </i><br />(Tomatoes, Onions, Garlic, Dhania, Ginger, Carrots, Courgettes, Capsicum, Terere,
                    Managu, Kunde, Kahurura, Sukuma wiki, Spinach, Cabbage, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Lettuce). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><i>FRUITS </i><br />(Passion fruits, Bananas, Avocados and Watermelon).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><i> TUBERS</i><br /> (Potatoes, Ngwaci, Pumpkin).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><i>CEREALS</i><br />(Maize, Beans, Njahi, Ndengu, Pigeon Pea, Njugu, Lentils and Kamande).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>We are looking forward to supporting our women in farming with the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seeds / Plant materials (access to better quality seed).</li>
            <li>Fertilizers. </li>
            <li>Quick low-interest loans to facilitate their maintenance labor and markets. </li>
            <li>Digital services to share key information on production, weather, finance and markets.</li>
            <li>Support on land preparation through plowing using tracks to avoid spread of Covid-19 virus.</li>
            <li>Connect them to markets and services so they can produce more and earn more.</li>
            <li>Provide technical expertise as well as external peer reviewers. </li>
            <li>Helping them to improve their soil and manage pests.</li>
            <li>Water for irrigation and clean water use of solar pumps.</li>
            <li>Most cannot produce a large enough volume of products to interest buyers, and when they do, they are
                often hit with high transaction costs, making it difficult to earn a living and compete in markets. They
                need our capital support for expansion.</li>
            <li>Increase their capacity to save and build assets to ensure a more stable future.</li>
            <li>Financial Inclusion and literacy – for remittance recipient families can increase opportunities for
                formal savings and investment. In turn, these mechanisms can build the human capital of remittance
                families and improve their living standards through better education, health and housing. We also have
                alternative savings for some of the communities we are serving, where banks are very far and they don’t
                know the importance of savings & loans.</li>
            <li>Help them to preserve their harvest (Drying, chilling and freezing) to prevent loss of a significant
                fraction of the harvest between gathering, transporting and selling at markets.</li>
            <li>Provide photovoltaic (PV) driven machinery (Grinder, mills, mechanical / electrical water pumps) to
                process units for crops, fruits, and spices, refrigerating, ice making, cold storage and drying.</li>
            <li>Introduce technology that will allow our women in the communities we are serving to access a wider range
                of financial products. </li>
            <li>Try to insure them for unavoidable risks that cannot be managed otherwise.</li>
            <li>Pay special attention to the role of women and adolescent girls, who make up a large percentage of the
                workforce in agriculture and food system in developing countries. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <p>At UCESCO, we know the importance of animal sourced foods for ending hunger and poverty in areas of
                high malnutrition. They are the fastest way of getting vital nutrients to people who need them most
                among the women-led households we are serving. We also know that health diets are balanced diets.
                Together with livestock, crops, provide an important source of nutrition and income for our women. </p>
            <p>That is why UCESCO plans to donate to some families in rural areas with enough space for livestock for
                either one cow / 10 to 50 flocks of chicks / 3 goats / 3 sheep / set up bees’ centers/ fish bonds, and
                other material goods, then train them and educate on the idea of passing on the gift to another needy
                family. This Concept of “passing on the gift” means that some form of the Livestock product (be it eggs,
                milk, wool or offspring) gets passed on to others in need so that the cycle may continue and build
                sustainable communities. This also helps to instill a sense of pride and dignity within these
                communities. </p>
            <p>Livestock provide a wide range of nutritious protein rich food stuffs, such as eggs, meat, milk, and
                honey, which can be processed into a variety of products. Animals like goats are known for delicious
                milk, which can be used to create cheese that can be sold for income, in turn providing a family’s
                children the opportunity to go to school. Cows can give four gallons of milk a day, which families can
                drink to boost their nutrition or sell for extra income or make products like butter, cheese or yogurt
                to sell for more income. Honeybees boost income through sales of honey, and wax while stimulating growth
                of family’s crops through pollination. Manure is used as fertilizers for crops and as fuel for cooking
                in our villages.
                It can be composted or used for the production of methane in biogas digesters and drought power for crop
                cultivation, and transportation for people and goods to market. In the end, we will also be contribution
                to a more circular and sustainable environment and economy.

            <p>Also Livestock is where we get skins to make Leather, Pelts, Fibres such as wool, Mohair, Cashmere that
                our women use to make handmade products at our Curio Shops on top of other products made by our women
                such as Jewelries, Baskets, Beadwork, Necklaces, Carpets, Africa Wears Clothes, Liquid soaps, closed and
                open leather shoes, Masaai closed and open shoes, African ladies wear; Light material, embroidered
                material headgear (Gele), Fabrics, hoodies, Vitenges, African wedding outfits with blowing colors. All
                they require ethic clothing designs, with a large choice of African. </p>
            <p>At the same time, some families/communities we serve with no access to financial services often use
                livestock as a form of asset management, investing in animals when they have extra money, and selling
                them when they need cash or other necessities. This strengthens the resilience of those families in the
                face of economic and climate shocks, enabling them to plan for the future. </p>
            <p>We also support our women to protect their animal health, boost productivity and sustainability, link
                them to profitable markets, expose them to current technology transfer, credit for restocking, animal
                health services delivery, feed and breed improvement, and husbandry practices, increase their
                productivity and profitability by giving them direct access to critically needed resources, services and
                markets.</p>

            <p>Market Access</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most Vulnerable women often face serious difficulties in accessing markets to sell their products
                    and goods in the market place. Some are illiterates and analogue without even a small smart
                    phone/IPad/ or notebook to sell their products through digital platform, especially during this
                    pandemic period of corona Virus. They are constrained by their remote location or slum, and lack of
                    business skills and an organization that could give them the bargaining power they require to
                    interact on equal terms with other market intermediaries. </li>
                <li>It isn’t always easy to connect these women to markets, nor to ensure their produce meets market
                    standards. Unequal distribution of power, also means these women from disadvantaged communities can
                    earn significant less than, other actors, such as large processors, retailers and exporters.</li>
                <li>Therefore, helping poor women in the communities we are serving to access markets is a top priority
                    for UCESCO. Better access to domestic and international markets allows our women to reliably sell
                    more produce, with better quality and at higher prices which will help their children to go to
                    school and feed them well as well as live their independent life as they will be part of social
                    change in these communities’ economic development. This in turn encourages them to invest in their
                    own businesses and increase the quantity, quality and diversity of the goods they produce.</li>
                <li>That is why UCESCO supports women to set up Hubs that are run by a Board of Directors appointed by
                    themselves. Each Hub offers a range of different services to its members, support access to credit,
                    the opportunity to buy quality feed at lower prices or purchasing supplies that can be difficult and
                    expensive to access in rural areas such as de-wormers. Hubs are much more than service providers. In
                    rural areas, it can be difficult for farmers to even access markets to sell their goods. Transport
                    can be expensive and disadvantaged women are forced to sell to an intermediary, who takes a
                    substantial amount of their profits. Through the Hubs, our women groups increase their bargaining
                    power, transforming into active participants in local economies. By pooling their products and
                    selling them in bulk, farmers can negotiate better prices and retain more of the profits. The Hubs
                    also help them to organize transport and can secure large contracts with more Signiant customers
                    such as dairies, restaurants and supermarkets as well as exporting to other countries and guarantee
                    their members to deliver quality products at the levels needed to meet big orders. </li>
                <li>
                    <p>At UCESCO, we also help women through our local staff: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A. To identify opportunities to increase their incomes within different value chains.</li>
                        <li>B. To sell their products out of their communities/ country to increase their return on
                            investment.</li>
                        <li>C. To partner with the private sector e.g. restaurants, supermarkets, malls etc. to provide
                            them with a stable market for their products.</li>
                        <li>D. To set up stores for them to sell their products.</li>
                        <li>E. Carry out campaigns to advertise their products where needed.</li>
                        <li>F. To train them and give them technical support to deliver.</li>
                        <li>G. To support them with a revolving loan fund to meet larger orders without selling through
                            third partners, to ensure more money goes back to the producers.</li>
                        <li>H. To enable them access credits at a reduced rate through a guarantee scheme by partnering
                            with local banks. </li>

            <p>Environmental Sustainability</p>
            <p>Our expert staff work with our women as they integrate climate-smart agricultural practices on their
                farms to increase resilience and crop production. We promote agro ecology and biodiversity, deploy soil
                and water conservation techniques, and reduce carbon footprints. We also support biogas plants that
                provide clean energy to local households, and irrigation projects that use water more efficiently. </p>

                    <p>We empower our women in 5 areas: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Developing skills for growth <br />
                                We believe in connected economies. An active market place for our women creates income,
                                savings, Education, Employment and opportunities for communities to retain their people
                                and develop new skills and further earning potential.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Sustainable Growth<br />Making the change from informal to formal markets isn’t an easy
                                one. Informal markets transactions are rarely cash-in-hand and customers expect products
                                to be a certain size and shape, as well as meet a set of quality standards. Business
                                require careful management, which is why we provide training and support from local
                                experts as our business women scale up production and sales.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Production Quantity<br />Dairies, supermarket chains, restaurants and other big buyers
                                want to know that their suppliers can deliver a consistent supply through the year.
                                Usually, they want to buy in bulk from fewer locations, as it reduces transport costs.
                                This can be a challenge for local farmers, who typically produce smaller quantiles of
                                their products. Scaling up production can bring extra cost and greater risks for smaller
                                business, but with the right training and support, new processes can be adopted that
                                make better use of available resources.</p>

                            <p>For livestock projects, improved animal management is the key part of increasing yields.
                                We train them to produce their own feed for their dairy cows. Not only does this reduce
                                their cost, but it also improves their animal nutrition, and more than doubles the milk
                                yield; increasing incomes as a result.</p>
                            <p>We also train them on how to use artificial incubators to hatch chicks, to keep their
                                hens laying for longer, increasing income from egg sales and how to vaccinate and deworm
                                their animals to increase their produce and income. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Production Quality<br />When selling to formal markets, quality is also important. Buyers
                                want to know they are getting a reliable product that is safe to consume because it
                                meets hygiene rules and regulations. We connect them with a local veterinarian who helps
                                them identify and treat the problem their animal might have.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Business management<br />As farmers continue to scale up their business, ongoing training
                                is essential. Selling into formal markets can be very different than local markets.
                                Suppliers and vendors need to be managed, product quality needs to be carefully
                                controlled and new markets need to be found for goods. Reliability is particularly
                                important in formal markets, as it’s hard to retain clients if orders are not delivered
                                on time. </p>
                            <p>When farmers sell at local markets, they get paid in cash right away. But when they sell
                                to other businesses, they often don’t receive their money for 2-4 weeks. Working capital
                                is needed to pay suppliers, staff and other core costs, and for many farmers that means
                                they need to take out a business loan. To get approved, they need to show a business
                                plan and be able to provide a record of their accounts. Record keeping and writing a
                                business plan can be very daunting at first, that is why we provide business training to
                                support farmers as they take these steps, making sure they have the skills and expertise
                                needed to make their business successful. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Use of Technology<br />At the heart of transformation is constant innovation. Our women
                                require a diverse set of tools and service as they build and often come with high
                                startup costs, making them out of reach for many disadvantage women and especially those
                                in the communities who have digital knowledge, because most of them are illiterate.
                                Literacy is the pathway to a better quality of life. It has the power to improve health
                                and diminish poverty for individuals, families and communities, and is fundamental to
                                economic and social progress. </p>
                            <p>UCESCO wants to help ensure Women literacy levels continue to rise, to provide
                                opportunities, which allow our women to advance their lifestyle and business. The
                                participating women are among the most vulnerable we are serving, but they hold the
                                potential to be production citizens. To fulfill that potential, they must become
                                literate in oral and digital world and understand the cultural norms of life in Africa
                                and the rest of the World.</p>
                            <p>For the last 3 years, UCESCO has been a critical junction for vulnerable women who need a
                                safe, warm environment in which to learn English and technology. It is especially
                                valuable for marginalized women who for cultural reasons cannot access education due to
                                barriers such as poor background, remote or culture. </p>

    </ol>
    <h4 id="TargetGroups">Target Groups</h4>
    <p>The target groups for this project are all Children and Women of the UCESCO target communities, which are poor
        and vulnerable in Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Emphasis will however be given to orphans, disadvantaged
        women-led-households, and those with pre-existing conditions such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, Chronic respiratory
        diseases, Malnutrition and Cancer. </p>
    <p>Food donations will also be made to vulnerable households with children under the age of 2 years to mitigate the
        effects of increase in food prices and to protect children nutrition.</p>
    <p>UCESCO will be collaborating with local governments, School teachers, University volunteers and like-minded
        organizations and community leaders. The scope and level of collaboration will be determined by the taskforces
        in each community who will map out the implementation guidelines. </p>
    <h4 id="Monitoring">Monitoring and Evaluation</h4>
    <p>There will be continuous monitoring and evaluation of implementation of our funded activities by the technical
        team. Reports will be generated and shared with all our stakeholders at regular intervals. Monthly meetings will
        take place for feedback and reviews. UCESCO will strengthen monitoring and evaluation system of this plan as
        follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conduct a survey on the effects of covid-19 to communities we are serving.</li>
        <li>Develop an integrated M & E system to include Covid-19 to communities we are serving. </li>
        <li>Develop an integrated M & E system to include Covid-19 and future crisis. </li>
        <li>Carry out regular M & E of emergency response activities. </li>
        <li>Conduct feedback forums. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="Resource">Resource Mobilization & Financing</h4>
    <p>This plan will be financed through support from: </p>
